Place svg assets sized for xdpi in original/

Make sure you have ImageMagick installed.  On a mac I suggest you use this:

http://cactuslab.com/imagemagick/

To generate the scaled .png's:

$ cd original
$ ./convert.sh

Now inspect the generated png's, if any need to be adjusted manually for a specific dpi, just place the manually created .png file in the appropriate dpi folder underneith the original/ directory.

--- TODO: 

bug: on OS X for some reason icons were being at 7x7 instead of 18x18?
	happens if convert is run twice
